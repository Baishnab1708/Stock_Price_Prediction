📘 Stock Price Prediction

This project focuses on predicting stock prices for Google's stock (GOOG) using historical data. It combines data collection, trend analysis, and deep learning to deliver accurate forecasts.

✨ Features

📊 Data Collection: Fetch historical stock data from 2010 to 2023 using the yfinance library.
📈 Trend Analysis: Analyze stock price trends with 30, 60, and 90-day moving averages.
🧹 Data Preprocessing: Scale data using Min-Max scaling for model compatibility.
🤖 Deep Learning: Build and train an LSTM model for time-series prediction.
📉 Performance Evaluation: Measure accuracy with metrics like MAE, MSE, RMSE, and R².
🖼️ Visualization: Compare actual and predicted prices with clear visual graphs.
🛠️ Prerequisites

Ensure the following Python libraries are installed:

TensorFlow
NumPy
Pandas
Matplotlib
yFinance
mplFinance
Scikit-learn

🚀 How to Run
